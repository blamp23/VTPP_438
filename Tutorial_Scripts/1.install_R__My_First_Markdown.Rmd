# Introduction {.tabset}

Welcome to R! R is a programming language primarily used for statistical analysis, but it is one of the most commonly used languages that you will see in bioinformatics. By the end of this tutorial you will have

-   Downloaded R to your system
-   Installed Rstudio
-   Set up a working directory
-   Create an Rmarkdown document

While it is fine to copy a tutorial for learning purposes, please note that there are a million ways to achieve the same output when it comes to programming. Hopefully by the end of the course you will be able to use R as a tool to aid in any form of research that you encounter!

## 1.Install R and Rstudio

For a video walkthrough - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9EBlFDGG4k>

As of 8/16/2024, Version 4.4.1 is the most up to date

Install R from this website - <https://cran.r-project.org/>

#### Mac install

You need to know if you are using an Intel or Apple Silicone (M chip) processor.

Download R for macOS -\> R-4.4.1-arm64.pkg (M1-3) or R-4.4.1-x86_64.pkg (Intel)

Double click the downloaded file

Click through setup wizard

#### Windows install

You need to be running at least windows 10 (you probably are).

Download R for Windows -\> base -\> Download R-4.4.1 for Windows

Double click the downloaded file

Click through setup wizard

#### Setup wizard

The defalt suggestions given to you by R is fine, it should just install to your program files.

### Rstudio

Installing R by itself basically just downloads the language to your computer. In order to create, run, and publish scripts, you need to install Rstudio.

Install link - <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

Download the correct installation for your operating system, then double click the file once it has downloaded.

Click through default suggestions in setup wizard.

## 2.Creating a Project Directory

Directory = The system in how files are organized in your computer

Any time you are working on a new project, it is helpful to create a new working directory for the duration of the project. I suggest to make a new folder in your computer called `VTPP_438` where you can keep all of your projects that you work on throughout the semester.

1.  **In File Explorer** Create `VTPP_438` folder

2.  **In Rstudio** Click File -> New Directory -> New Project -> Name Directory `Tutorial` as a subdirectory of `VTPP_438`

3.  **In File Explorer** Create 2 folders inside of   `Tutorial`, `raw_data` and `processed_data`

4.  In a text editor application, create a file called README, with a **SHORT** description of the project, and what each file in your project directory does. This can be updated whenever something new is uploaded. Save to `Tutorial`

Creating a README document is essential in research for reproductabillity of your code! Anyone should be able to look at this document and understand the workflow of your project.

## 3.Create an Rmarkdown Document

You are currently reading an Rmarkdown HTML! Now it is time to create your own...

1.  Make sure Rstudio is cloesd
2.  **In File Explorer** Go to the `Tutorial` project that you created, and double click on it to open Rstudio whithin the tutorial enviroment
2.  Click File -> New File -> Rmarkdown... -> OK
3.  Press `Knit` in the top left on your screen (It should look like a blue ball of yarn)
4.  Save it as `my_first_markdown`
5.  Look at the output HTML

Rmarkdown is a super cool way to convey your research to the public. It automatically formats text and code together, and the output html can be sent to anyone to look at without needing to run the R script again.

## 4.Example .Rmd:

title: "Untitled"

author: "Benji Lamp"

date: "`r Sys.Date()`"

output: html_document


### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
